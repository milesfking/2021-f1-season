# Visualizing the Results of the 2021 Formula One Season

The battle for 2021 Formula One Drivers' World Championship was one of the closest battles in the sports history, with Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen going head-to-head in the final lap of the season's final race to decide a champion. Using an array of racing data sourced from [Ergast]("https://ergast.com/mrd/"), I tidied a JSON object to display the points won for each driver and constructor across each of the 22 races.

Then, using the `gganimate` R package, I visualized the cumulative standings of both the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships over time to exemplify just how competitive the 2021 Formula One Season was.
